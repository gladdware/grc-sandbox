# GNU Radio Companion Sandbox

Workspace for my GNU Radio Companion flow graphs. I figured other people
starting out in the world of SDR may find these useful.

## Dependencies

1. Osmocom RTL-SDR driver and gr-osmocom (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)
  * The RTL-SDR blocks could be swapped out for other SDRs
2. GNU Radio 3.6.3 with GNU Radio Companion (http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki)
  * Older versions may work also, but I'm using 3.6.3
